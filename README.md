# ledger-app-hns

This is a key management application for the Handshake Protocol. With support
for both the Ledger Nano S and Ledger Nano X, it allows users to create extended
public keys, addresses, and signatures for valid Handshake transactions. It
can be used with the [hsd-ledger][hsd-ledger] client library to interact with
wallet software.

This document serves as an overview of the relevant technical and licensing
details for this application. For more general information on developing
for Ledger personal security devices please read the official Ledger developer
documentation [here][ledger].

For a walk-through of a Ledger application, check out the [nanos-app-sia][sia]
project. The Nebulous Inc. developers have done a wonderful job of documenting
both the high-level architecture and low-level implementation details of
Nano S app development.

<br/>

## Linux Install

To load the app on your Ledger Nanos S without using Docker:
- Follow the setup instructions [here][setup].
- Run `make load` in the root of this git repo.
- Follow the terminal and on-device instructions (this process takes a while).

Once installation is complete, install the [client library][hsd-ledger].

>Note: macOS and Windows are not supported. If you are _not_ running Linux,
please follow the Docker instructions below.

[setup]: https://developers.ledger.com/docs/nano-app/load/

<br/>

## Docker Install

If you are running [Linux](#linux-host), the only dependency is Docker. If you
are running [macOS](#macos-or-windows-host) or [Windows](#macos-or-windows-host)
you will also need to setup a Python virtualenv and install developer tools
provided by Ledger. Detailed instructions for each host environment are below.

Once installation is complete, install the [client library][hsd-ledger].

>Note: all example commands begin with the $ symbol. This symbol signifies
a shell command prompt. The command prompt in your shell may be different.
Do not copy the $ symbol when using the commands in your shell.

<br/>

### Linux Host
#### Install Dependencies
First, be sure to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed
and running on your machine.

#### Install `ledger-app-hns`

Clone the git repo:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/handshake-org/ledger-app-hns.git
$ cd ledger-app-hns
```

- Connect the Ledger Nano S to your machine via USB.
- Unlock the device.
- Navigate to the device's main menu.

If your device is running firmware v1.6.0, run:
```bash
$ docker build --build-arg CACHE_BUST="$(date)" -f Dockerfile.build -t ledger-app-hns-build .
$ docker run --rm --privileged ledger-app-hns-build make load
```

If your device is running firmware v1.5.5, run:
```bash
$ docker build --build-arg GIT_REF="nanos-1553" --build-arg CACHE_BUST="$(date)" -f Dockerfile.build -t ledger-app-hns-build .
$ docker run --rm --privileged ledger-app-hns-build make load
```

>Note: the above `docker run` command uses the `--privileged` flag, which gives
>the docker container full access to your host machine. If you know the location
>of your connected Ledger Nano S you can >replace the `--privileged` tag
>with `--device=/path/to/usb/device`.

- Follow the terminal and on-device instructions (this process takes a while).

##### Nano X

If you are using a Nano X, run:

```bash
$ docker build --build-arg GIT_NAME="nanox-secure-sdk" --build-arg GIT_REF="1.2.4-5.1" \
               --build-arg CACHE_BUST="$(date)" -f Dockerfile.build -t ledger-app-hns-build .
$ docker run --rm --privileged ledger-app-hns-build make load
```

<br/>

### macOS or Windows Host
#### Install Dependencies
First, be sure to have the following development dependencies installed on
your machine:
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- Python 2.7 development environment (`python2`, `python2-dev`, `virtualenv`)
- `make`
- `gcc`
- `g++`
- `git`

Next, create a directory to store the [Nano S Secure SDK][sdk] and the Python
virtual environment for the [Python Loader tool][loader]. The SDK is used in
`ledger-app-hns` to interact with the device's operating system and crypto
libraries. The loader tool loads compiled applications onto your Ledger Nano S.

It does not matter where you store the SDK or the virtual environment.
For simplicity, this guide stores them together in a directory called
`ledger-tools`.

To begin, open a terminal shell and run:
```bash
$ mkdir ledger-tools
$ cd ledger-tools
```

#### Install Nano S Secure SDK
Before installing the SDK, you will need to know what firmware version is
running on your Ledger Nano S. If you do not know how to check your firmware
version, follow the instructions [here][firmware]. This application supports
`v1.6.0 and `v1.5.5`.

Clone the git repo:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ledgerhq/nanos-secure-sdk.git
```

If your device is running firmware v1.6.0 checkout the `nanos-1612` branch:
```bash
$ git checkout nanos-1612
```

If your device is running firmware v1.5.5 checkout the `nanos-1553` branch:
```bash
$ git checkout nanos-1553
```

Set the `BOLOS_SDK` environment variable to the absolute path
  of the SDK repo:
```bash
$ cd nanos-secure-sdk
$ export BOLOS_SDK=`pwd`
$ cd ..
```

#### Install Python Loader for Ledger Nano S
Now, you will need to install the Python [loader tool][loader]. This process
will involve: navigating back to the root of the `ledger-tools` directory,
creating and activating a Python virtual environment, and installing the
`ledgerblue` loader tools.

Run:
```bash
$ virtualenv ledger
$ source ledger/bin/activate
$ pip install ledgerblue
$ pip install Pillow
```

#### Install `ledger-app-hns`
We are ready to install the application! This process will involve: cloning
the git repo into the `ledger-tools` directory, checking out the branch that
corresponds to your device's firmware version, compiling the application, and
loading it onto your device. The last two steps are triggered by one
`make` command.

Clone the git repo:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/handshake-org/ledger-app-hns.git
$ cd ledger-app-hns
```

- Start Docker.
- Connect the Ledger Nano S to your machine via USB.
- Unlock the device.
- Navigate to the device's main menu.

If your device is running firmware v1.6.0, run:
```bash
$ make docker-load
```

If your device is running firmware v1.5.5, run:
```bash
$ GIT_REF="nanos-1553" make docker-load
```

- Follow the terminal and on-device instructions (this process takes a while).

<br/>

## Build Apps Only (for emulator)

To build both Nano S and Nano X apps using Docker:

```bash
$ make docker-build-all
```

This will run the build in a docker container and copy the final builds to
`/bin/hns-nanos.elf` and `/bin/hns-nanox.elf`

These two binaries can be executed inside the
[Speculos emulator](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/speculos).
For example, to run the built Nano S app in the emulator from docker:

```
docker run -v \
  /path/to/ledger-app-hns/bin:/speculos/apps \
  --publish 5900:5900 \
  -it \
  ledgerhq/speculos \
  --display headless \
  --vnc-port 5900 \
  --vnc-password=xyz \
  apps/hns-nanos.elf \
  --model nanos
```

The command is explained in detail in the Speculos docs. Just note the path
to the `/bin` directory and `model` argument. The emulated device can be
accessed using a VNC client. On OSX, the `--vnc-password` argument is required
and will be requested by the VNC client.

## Tests

A suite of tests have been added to the [client library][tests]. They include
device tests with mocked transaction data, and end-to-end tests involving an
active, `hsd` node. All tests require a Ledger Nano S configured with the
following test seed:

```
abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon
abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon about
```

## APDU Command Specification

This application interacts with a computer host through the APDU communication
protocol. This specification describes the APDU command interface for
`ledger-app-hns`.

The basic structure of an APDU command consists of a 5 byte header followed
by a variable amount of command input data. The header for an HNS Ledger
application command takes the following structure:

>NOTE: For the remainder of this document all lengths are represented in bytes.
All data is represented as little-endian bytestrings except where noted.

| Field | Len | Purpose                                               |
| ----  | --- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| CLA   | 1   | Instruction class - the type of command (always 0xe0) |
| INS   | 1   | Instruction code - the specific command               |
| P1    | 1   | Instruction param #1                                  |
| P2    | 1   | Instruction param #2                                  |
| LC    | 1   | Length of command input data                          |

\*The above description is unique to this application. Specifically, the APDU protocol
allows for a larger LC field. A more general description of the APDU message protocol
can be found [here][apdu].

### GET PUBLIC KEY
#### Description

This command returns a public key for the given BIP32 path.
Using the APDU parameter fields it can also return a Bech32
encoded address for the public key, or the details needed
reconstruct the extended public key at the specified level
in the HD tree.

The first instruction param (P1) can be used to require on-device
confirmation by setting the least significant bit. The next two
lowest bits are used to signify the network. The network flag is
only used for xpub confirmation. Address generation will parse the
network from the derivation path. If an unknown coin type is passed
during address generation, an error will be returned.

The second instruction param indicates which, if any, additional details
to return, i.e. extended public details and/or address. If confirmation
is turned on, and an address is generated, the address will be displayed
on screen. The next precedence will be given to extended public key
details. Otherwise, the public key will be displayed for confirmation.

>NOTE: an on-device warning will be displayed for non-hardened
derivation at the BIP44 account level or above. It will also be
displayed for derivations past the address index level.

#### Structure
##### Header

| CLA   | INS   | P1   | P2    | LC  |
| ----- | ----- | ---- | ----- | --- |
| 0xe0  | 0x42  | \*var | \*\*var | var |

\* P1:

- 0x00 = No confimation
- 0x01 = Require confirmation

0x06 is used as a mask to check second and third least significant bits.
- 0x00 = Mainnet
- 0x02 = Testnet
- 0x04 = Regtest
- 0x06 = Simnet

\*\* P2:
- 0x00 = Public key only
- 0x01 = Public key + chain code + parent fingerprint
- 0x02 = Public key + address
- 0x03 = Public key + chain code + parent fingerprint + address

### GET INPUT SIGNATURE
#### Description

This command handles the entire input signature creation process.
It operates in two modes: [parse](#parse) and [sign](#sign). When
engaged in parse mode, transaction details are sent to the device
where they are parsed, cached, and prepared for signing. Once all
tx details have been parsed, the user can send signature requests
for each input. The first signature request for a particular tx
requires on-device confirmation of the txid.

Both modes may require multiple message exchanges between the
client and the device. The first instruction param (P1) indicates
if a message is the initial one. An initial parse message clears
any cached transaction details from memory and restarts the signing
process. The initial message in a signature request should pass the
path of the signing key, the sighash type, the input, and the first
182 bytes of the input script (including the varint script size).
If the entire script does not fit into the first message, additional
messages will be necessary to send the rest of the script. The
subsequent messages should only include the remaining script bytes.

The second instruction param (P2) indicates the operation mode.

>NOTE: Signature requests for non-standard BIP44 address paths
will be rejected.

#### Structure - Parse Mode <a href="#parse"></a>

\* P1:
- 0x01 = Initial message
- 0x00 = Following message

##### Input data

>NOTE: The transaction details should be sent in packets of up to
255 bytes. This is because the APDU command data length is represented
as a uint8_t.

>NOTE: If the size of the input data is larger than the APDU buffer size, the
script must be split into smaller packet sizes and sent in multiple messages.
Subsequent messages should only send the remaining script bytes. All other
input data i.e., the path, sighash type, prevout, value, sequence, and script
length, should not be resent.

>NOTE: The application keeps track of the number of script bytes it has parsed
and will return a SUCCESS status word, without any response data, if it
successfully parsed the input data, but is expecting more bytes. After parsing
all script bytes, the signature will be generated and returned.
